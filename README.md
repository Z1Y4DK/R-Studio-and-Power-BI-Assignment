## **Overview:**

I looked into Hollywoods Most Profitable Stories!ðŸ’° In this project, I dived into this dataset, using RStudio and PowerBI to clean, filter, visualize, and analyze my data.

## **Project Structure:**

Data: Hollywoods Most Profitable Stories <p/>
Scripts: RStudio <p/>
Visualizations: Power BI <p/>
Documentations: Microsoft Powerpoint<p/>

## **âœ¨ RStudio:** âœ¨


RStudio is like a one-stop shop for everything related to the R programming language. It's where you can write, debug, and execute R code easily. Plus, it offers tools for data visualization and analysis, making it a go-to platform for data enthusiasts and researchers. This is one of the best Progamming tools used for Machine Learning.

Filtering: I utilized RStudios's robust filtering capabilities to focus on specific subsets of data, allowing for a more detailed analysis of particular aspects in the Dataset.

Data Type Transformation: Ensuring accurate data representation is key so I adjusted my data through RStudios to guarantee precision in calculations and visualizations using lines of code which cleaened up my Data. These lines of code could be seen in my Presentation.

Chart Creation: I used visual charts to highlight trends and patterns in the data that showed relationships between certain data compared to others.


## **Power BI:** ðŸ“Š

After RStudio I used Power BI to elevate the analysis to the next level:

Dashboard Design: The ultimate goal is to make complex data easily understandable. I crafted interactive dashboards in PowerBI, providing expert yet simple vizualisations for users to explore which can easily be interacted with.
